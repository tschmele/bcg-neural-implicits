Project repository for the module BCG. The project is based on the paper [Overfit Neural Networks as a Compact Shape Representation
](https://aps.arxiv.org/pdf/2009.09808v1.pdf) ([updated version](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=_QnwcbR-GG)).

Authors: Babak Sedaghat, Tristan Schmele

## Structure

The code is structured into three steps which are found in the folders [dataset-generation](https://github.com/tschmele/bcg-neural-implicits/tree/main/dataset-generation), [neurales-netzwerk](https://github.com/tschmele/bcg-neural-implicits/tree/main/neurales-netzwerk) and [error-evaluation](https://github.com/tschmele/bcg-neural-implicits/tree/main/error-evaluation).

[Paper](https://github.com/tschmele/bcg-neural-implicits/tree/main/Paper) contains the PDFs of both versions of the paper this project is based on.

[Pr√§sentation](https://github.com/tschmele/bcg-neural-implicits/tree/main/Pr%C3%A4sentation) and [Bilder](https://github.com/tschmele/bcg-neural-implicits/tree/main/Bilder) contain presentations held in class for BCG and some of the images used in them.

## Documentation

Documentation of the project and explanation of the three coding steps are found in the corresponding folders README file or in the [Wiki](https://github.com/tschmele/bcg-neural-implicits/wiki).
